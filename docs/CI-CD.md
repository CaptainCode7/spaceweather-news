# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document describes the CI/CD pipeline for the Spaceweather News application.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and provides:

- Automated testing and linting
- Multi-environment deployments (dev, staging, production)
- Manual approval gates for production
- CDK Pipeline option for advanced workflows

## Pipeline Structure

### Workflow Triggers

- **Push to `develop`**: Deploys to development environment
- **Push to `main`**: Deploys to staging, then production (with approval)
- **Pull requests to `main`**: Runs tests only
- **Commit message contains `[deploy-pipeline]`**: Deploys CDK Pipeline

### Jobs

#### 1. Test and Lint (`test`)
Runs on every push and PR:
- Code checkout
- Node.js and pnpm setup
- Dependencies installation with caching
- Linting (ESLint)
- Unit tests (Jest)
- Next.js build
- CDK synthesis

#### 2. Deploy to Development (`deploy-dev`)
Runs on pushes to `develop` branch:
- Deploys to AWS development environment
- No manual approval required
- Uses development configuration

#### 3. Deploy to Staging (`deploy-staging`)
Runs on pushes to `main` branch:
- Deploys to AWS staging environment
- No manual approval required
- Uses staging configuration

#### 4. Deploy to Production (`deploy-prod`)
Runs after successful staging deployment:
- **Requires manual approval**
- Deploys to AWS production environment
- Uses production configuration

#### 5. Deploy CDK Pipeline (`deploy-pipeline`)
Runs when commit message contains `[deploy-pipeline]`:
- Deploys the CDK Pipeline stack
- Creates automated AWS CodePipeline
- One-time setup for advanced workflows

## Environment Configuration

### GitHub Secrets Required

Add these to your repository settings:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID          # AWS access key for deployment
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY      # AWS secret access key
```

### GitHub Variables Required

Add these to your repository settings:

```
AWS_REGION                 # AWS region (e.g., us-east-1)
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID            # 12-digit AWS account ID
```

### Environment-Specific Configuration

Each environment uses different configurations defined in `cdk/lib/config.ts`:

#### Development
- Environment: `development`
- Auto-deployment from `develop` branch
- Relaxed throttling limits
- Local development CORS origins

#### Staging  
- Environment: `staging`
- Auto-deployment from `main` branch
- Production-like configuration
- Staging domain CORS origins

#### Production
- Environment: `production` 
- Manual approval required
- Strict throttling limits
- Production domain CORS origins
- Resource retention policies

## Deployment Commands

### Manual Deployment

You can deploy manually using these commands:

```bash
# Deploy to development
pnpm cdk:deploy:dev

# Deploy to staging
pnpm cdk:deploy:staging

# Deploy to production (with confirmation)
pnpm cdk:deploy:prod

# Deploy CDK Pipeline
pnpm cdk:deploy:pipeline
```

### Bootstrap (One-time setup)

```bash
# Bootstrap CDK in your AWS account/region
pnpm bootstrap
```

## Approval Process

### Production Deployments

Production deployments require manual approval:

1. Staging deployment completes successfully
2. GitHub creates a pending approval request
3. Authorized team members can review and approve
4. Production deployment proceeds after approval

### Approval Configuration

Configure approvers in your repository:

1. Go to Settings â†’ Environments
2. Add "production" environment
3. Configure required reviewers
4. Set approval timeout

## CDK Pipeline (Advanced)

The CDK Pipeline provides a more sophisticated AWS-native CI/CD solution:

### Features
- Multi-stage deployment with approval gates
- Self-mutating pipeline
- Integration with AWS CodePipeline
- Advanced deployment strategies
- Better cost optimization

### Deployment

Deploy the pipeline with:

```bash
cd cdk
pnpm cdk deploy SpaceweatherPipelineStack \
  --require-approval never \
  -c deploy-pipeline=true \
  -c repo-owner=your-github-username \
  -c repo-name=tutorial-1
```

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Source**: GitHub repository monitoring
2. **Build & Test**: Synthesis and testing
3. **Development**: Auto-deploy to dev environment
4. **Staging**: Deploy to staging with pre/post hooks
5. **Production**: Deploy to production with manual approval

## Monitoring and Alerting

### GitHub Actions Monitoring

- View workflow runs in the Actions tab
- Configure notifications for failed deployments
- Monitor deployment frequency and success rates

### AWS Monitoring

- CloudWatch logs for deployment details
- CDK deployment events
- Resource-level monitoring

### Notifications

Configure Slack/email notifications:

```yaml
# Add to workflow
- name: Notify on failure
  if: failure()
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: failure
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

## Security Best Practices

### Secrets Management
- Use GitHub secrets for sensitive data
- Rotate AWS credentials regularly
- Use least-privilege IAM policies
- Enable AWS CloudTrail logging

### Branch Protection
- Require PR reviews for main branch
- Require status checks to pass
- Restrict direct pushes to main
- Enable branch deletion protection

### Environment Isolation
- Separate AWS accounts for production
- Use different IAM roles per environment
- Implement network segmentation
- Enable AWS Config for compliance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. AWS Credentials
```
Error: AWS credentials not configured
```
**Solution**: Check GitHub secrets are properly set

#### 2. CDK Bootstrap
```
Error: Bootstrap stack not found
```
**Solution**: Run `pnpm bootstrap` first

#### 3. Permission Denied
```
Error: Access denied for operation
```
**Solution**: Check IAM permissions for deployment role

#### 4. Environment Variables
```
Error: Required environment variable not set
```
**Solution**: Check GitHub variables configuration

### Debug Steps

1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify AWS credentials and permissions
3. Test deployment locally
4. Check CDK synthesis output
5. Review CloudFormation events

### Getting Help

- Check deployment logs in GitHub Actions
- Review AWS CloudFormation stack events
- Enable CDK debug mode: `CDK_DEBUG=true`
- Use AWS CLI to verify resource states

## Cost Optimization

### GitHub Actions
- Use dependency caching
- Optimize test suites for speed
- Use appropriate runner sizes
- Monitor usage in billing

### AWS Resources
- Use appropriate instance sizes
- Enable auto-scaling where applicable
- Monitor costs with AWS Cost Explorer
- Set up billing alerts

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Update dependencies monthly
- Review and rotate secrets quarterly
- Monitor deployment success rates
- Update documentation as needed

### Updates
- GitHub Actions versions
- Node.js and pnpm versions
- AWS CDK versions
- Security patches
