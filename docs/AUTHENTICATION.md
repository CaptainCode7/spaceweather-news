# Authentication Status

## Current Status: Authentication Removed

**Note: Authentication features have been removed from this project to simplify the architecture and focus on the core space weather dashboard functionality.**

## What Was Removed

The following authentication-related components have been removed:

- AWS Cognito integration
- NextAuth.js setup
- Protected routes (`/protected/dashboard`)
- Authentication API routes (`/api/auth/[...nextauth]`)
- Sign-in and sign-out pages (`/auth/signin`, `/auth/signout`)
- User pool configuration in CDK
- Authentication-related environment variables

## Current Project Structure

The project now focuses on:

- **Public dashboard** at `/dashboard` - Space weather monitoring interface
- **API testing** on the home page - Simple API interaction examples
- **CDK infrastructure** for hosting the Next.js app and API endpoints
- **CI/CD pipeline** for automated deployments

## If You Want to Re-add Authentication

If you need authentication in the future, you can:

1. **Re-install NextAuth.js dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd nextjs-app
   pnpm add next-auth
   ```

2. **Restore the CDK authentication stack** from git history:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline | grep -i auth
   git checkout <commit-hash> -- cdk/lib/auth-stack.ts
   ```

3. **Recreate the authentication pages** and API routes

4. **Update the environment variables** in `.env.example`

## Alternative Simple Authentication

For a simpler approach, consider:

- **Basic HTTP authentication** for admin features
- **API keys** for programmatic access
- **Third-party services** like Auth0 or Firebase Auth
- **Simple username/password** with local storage (for development only)

## Current Environment Setup

The simplified project only requires:

```env
# API Configuration (set after CDK deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-gateway-url

# Environment
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the API URL after deploying your CDK stack.
