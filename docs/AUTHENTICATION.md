# Authentication Status

## Current Status: Authentication Removed

**Note: Authentication features have been removed from this project to simplify the architecture and focus on the core space weather dashboard functionality.**
## What is Authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is. In web applications, this typically means:
- Users can create accounts
- Users can log in with username/password or other methods
- The application remembers who is logged in
- Some features can be restricted to logged-in users only
## What Was Removed

The following authentication-related components have been removed:

- **AWS Cognito integration** - AWS's user management service
- **NextAuth.js setup** - Popular authentication library for Next.js
- **Protected routes** (`/protected/dashboard`) - Pages that required login
- **Authentication API routes** (`/api/auth/[...nextauth]`) - Backend code for authentication
- **Sign-in and sign-out pages** (`/auth/signin`, `/auth/signout`) - User interface for login
- **User pool configuration in CDK** - AWS infrastructure for user storage
- **Authentication-related environment variables** - Configuration settings
## Current Project Structure

The project now focuses on:

- **Public dashboard** at `/dashboard` - Space weather monitoring interface
- **API testing** on the home page - Simple API interaction examples
- **CDK infrastructure** for hosting the Next.js app and API endpoints
- **CI/CD pipeline** for automated deployments
## If You Want to Re-add Authentication

If you need authentication in the future, you can:

1. **Re-install NextAuth.js dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd nextjs-app
   pnpm add next-auth
   ```

2. **Restore the CDK authentication stack** from git history:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline | grep -i auth
   git checkout <commit-hash> -- cdk/lib/auth-stack.ts
   ```

3. **Recreate the authentication pages** and API routes

4. **Update the environment variables** in `.env.example`

## Alternative Simple Authentication

For a simpler approach, consider:

- **Basic HTTP authentication** for admin features
- **API keys** for programmatic access
- **Third-party services** like Auth0 or Firebase Auth
- **Simple username/password** with local storage (for development only)

## Current Environment Setup

The simplified project only requires:

```env
# API Configuration (set after CDK deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-gateway-url

# Environment
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the API URL after deploying your CDK stack.
