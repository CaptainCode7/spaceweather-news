Help me fix this bug:

Code with bug: ${input:buggycode:Paste the code that's not working}
What I expected: ${input:expected:What did you think would happen?}
What actually happened: ${input:actual:What actually happened? Include any error messages}

Please:
- Identify what's wrong
- Explain why it's happening in simple terms
- Show the corrected code with changes highlighted
- Explain how to avoid this mistake in the future
- Give me a tip for debugging similar issues

Remember I'm still learning, so explain your reasoning step by step.
