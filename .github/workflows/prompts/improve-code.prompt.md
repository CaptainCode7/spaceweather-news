Help me improve this code for better practices:

Current code: ${input:current:Paste your working but improvable code}
Technology: ${input:tech:TypeScript Lambda function, Tailwind component, etc.}

Please show:
- What's working but could be better (don't just rewrite everything)
- 2-3 specific improvements with explanations of why they're better
- The refactored version with changes clearly marked
- What patterns or principles these improvements demonstrate
- How this makes the code more maintainable/scalable
- Resources to learn more about these patterns

Focus on teaching me to recognize improvement opportunities myself in the future.
