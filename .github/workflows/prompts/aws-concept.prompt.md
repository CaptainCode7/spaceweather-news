Explain this AWS concept for web development:

AWS Service/Concept: ${input:concept:What AWS service or concept do you want to understand?}
My use case: ${input:usecase:How do you plan to use this in your web application?}

Please explain:
- What this service does in simple terms (relate to web development concepts I might know)
- How it connects to other AWS services I'm learning
- Cost implications and best practices for small projects
- How to set it up step-by-step for TypeScript development
- Common gotchas for beginners
- How to test/debug this locally during development
- What documentation to bookmark for future reference

Help me build a mental model of how AWS services work together for web applications.
