# TypeScript Web Development Guidelines

## Building on Playwright Experience
- Show how web app TypeScript differs from test automation TypeScript
- Explain when to use strict typing vs any (different from test scripts)
- Connect async patterns I know to API calling patterns
- Show proper module organization for web apps vs test suites

## Type Definitions for AWS
- Always show proper typing for AWS SDK responses
- Explain interface definitions for Lambda event/context objects
- Show how to type API Gateway requests/responses
- Include error type definitions for proper error handling

## Learning Approach
- Explain the "why" behind type choices, not just syntax
- Show common web development patterns in TypeScript
- Include refactoring examples from loose typing to strict typing
- Connect to testing concepts: "Think of types like test assertions for your code"

## Code Structure
- Show proper file organization for TypeScript web projects
- Explain barrel exports and module patterns
- Include examples of sharing types between frontend and backend
- Show how to structure AWS Lambda functions with proper typing

## Debugging and Development
- Include proper TypeScript debugging setup for VS Code
- Show how to read TypeScript compiler errors effectively
- Explain source maps for debugging deployed Lambda functions
- Include testing strategies for TypeScript code (building on my testing knowledge)
